# Rename Divi Projects

Unlock the full potential of Divi Projects to make your site truly unique!




## About

Rename Divi Projects is the perfect tool for customizing Divi’s default Projects post type to suit your unique needs. Completely transform the built-in Divi Projects into any type of content that fits your website.

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to change the project post type URL from 'project' to 'property' or 'book' or 'album' or anything you like, while keeping the functionality of the three Divi portfolio modules:

* [Portfolio](https://www.elegantthemes.com/modules/portfolio/)
* [Filterable Portfolio](https://www.elegantthemes.com/modules/filterable-portfolio/)
* [Fullwidth Portfolio](https://www.elegantthemes.com/modules/portfolio-carousel/) (Carousel)

Rename Divi Projects allows you to do this quickly, simply and without any coding.

### Customize the name

Change the default "Projects" post type to anything—properties, portfolios, books, or conferences—saving time and simplifying site management.

### Features

* **Choose your menu icon** Select a custom icon to better represent your new post type in the WordPress admin menu.
* **Modify slugs** Update the URL structure to reflect your new post type, keeping everything SEO-friendly.
* **Category and Tag control** Rename and re-slug your categories and tags to match your new custom post type
* **Why is this useful?** Perhaps your website showcases holiday letting properties, or advertises the books you have written, or you are in a band and want to display the albums you have released. It doesn’t make much sense semantically to list these as 'projects'.

### Getting started with Rename Divi Projects

As the name suggests Rename Divi Projects allows you to customize the default Divi Projects custom post type.

Why is this useful?

Perhaps your website showcases holiday letting properties, or advertises the books you have written, or you are in a band and want to display the albums you have released. It doesn’t make much sense semantically to list these as ‘projects’.

Wouldn’t it be great if you could change the project post type URL from ‘project’ to ‘property’ or ‘book’ or ‘album’ or anything you like, while keeping the functionality of the three Divi portfolio modules:

* [Filterable Portfolio](https://www.elegantthemes.com/modules/filterable-portfolio/)
* [Portfolio](https://www.elegantthemes.com/modules/portfolio/)
* [Portfolio Carousel](https://www.elegantthemes.com/modules/portfolio-carousel/)

The Rename Divi Projects plugin allows you to do this quickly, simply and without any coding.


#### Settings page

Once installed, navigate to Settings > Rename Divi Projects to customize your Projects post type.

The changes should happen immediately. Anything that once had a URL of /project/ will now have your new custom post slug. Should this not happen, first go to Settings > Permalinks and click Save Changes there to flush the permalinks (slug) cache.



### Reset to defaults

To reset the custom post type to the default Divi "Project" settings:

Your custom post type values will be kept in the database until to reactive the plugin again.

#### Deleting the plugin

When you delete the plugin from the Plugins screen, all your custom post type settings for the Project post type will then be deleted from the database.




## How it works

**Rename Divi Projects** offers an easy-to-use interface that allows you to fully customize the default Divi "Projects" post type without needing to write any code. Once the plugin is installed and activated, it adds a new settings page where you can rename and rebrand the Projects post type to fit your needs. This includes changing the post type name, menu icon, URL slug, and the names and slugs for associated categories and tags.

The plugin seamlessly integrates with the existing Divi ecosystem, allowing you to repurpose Projects into any type of custom content, such as properties, portfolios, or even events. Best of all, you can continue using Divi’s Projects modules to showcase and filter your new content type—no additional setup required.

**For developers**, the plugin works by dynamically registering the new values through WordPress’ register_post_type and register_taxonomy functions. It modifies the post type labels, slugs, and associated taxonomies, ensuring your changes are implemented site-wide. The plugin also automatically flushes WordPress rewrite rules, ensuring that any changes to your custom slugs are reflected immediately without manual intervention.

Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a WordPress beginner, Rename Divi Projects takes care of the heavy lifting, allowing you to fully customize Divi Projects in just a few clicks.
